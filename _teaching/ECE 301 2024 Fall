Here's a description tailored for ECE 301 at Case Western Reserve University:

Teaching Experience

Laboratory Instructor - ECE 301: Digital Logic Laboratory
Case Western Reserve University, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering

I served as one of primary laboratory instructors for ECE 301, a hands-on digital logic laboratory course at CWRU. This was a dedicated laboratory course focused on practical implementation and testing of digital circuits, complementing the theoretical digital logic curriculum.

My responsibilities included:

- Laboratory Instruction and Demonstrations**: Presented pre-lab concepts and demonstrations at the beginning of select sessions, introducing students to new circuit topologies, measurement techniques, and debugging methodologies. These presentations covered topics such as IC package identification, timing analysis, propagation delay measurement, and hazard detection in combinational circuits.

- Hands-on Laboratory Supervision: Guided students through weekly experiments involving the design, construction, and testing of digital circuits using breadboards, TTL/CMOS IC chips, and test equipment including oscilloscopes and logic analyzers.

- Technical Support and Debugging : Provided real-time assistance to students during lab sessions, helping them troubleshoot hardware implementations, identify timing issues, and resolve circuit malfunctions. This included teaching proper measurement techniques for rise/fall times, propagation delays, and signal integrity analysis.

- Assessment: Evaluated laboratory reports and practical implementations, providing detailed feedback on experimental methodology, data analysis, and technical documentation.

- Office Hours: Held regular office hours to support students with circuit design questions, pre-lab preparation, and post-lab analysis.

This role allowed me to develop strong instructional skills in demonstrating complex technical concepts through practical examples, while helping students bridge the gap between digital logic theory and real-world circuit implementation.
