I’m Ishika K. Kanakath — aspiring tech-leader and researcher.

I'm pursuing a PhD in Electrical & Computer Engineering at University of Washington. I design interdisciplinary systems that span neural engineering, electrical engineering, and computer science — with a mission to engineer impact.

I got my B.S./M.S. in Computer Engineering at Case Western Reserve University (where I served as the first female president of the student-run hackathon club and led a $10K scholarship drive in honor of my late mother). 

Welcome to my site: I hope I can inspire you with the work I do!
